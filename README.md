# Alexa integration with Kodi

## Upgrade to v2.5

For those of you doing an upgrade to the new version, please run the Slot generator again and repopulate all of your slots with the output. If you don't do this, the skill might seem to successfully build and save, but those with large libraries may encounter issues at runtime.

Besides the above, users on Heroku should just be able to do a `git pull` and `git push heroku master` to upgrade.

For Lambda users, the setup is completely different now, so please check the new documentaion.

When upgrading the code in general, remember to always update the Intents and Utterances in the skill.  If new slots were added, you will need to add those as well.

## Initial Computer Setup
There are a few things in the instructions that you will need to install before you can get started: Python 2.7 and git. There are numerous tutorials online about how to install these, so just Google how to install them on your OS if you are uncertain about how to proceed.

## Kodi Setup

Before a command from Alexa can be sent to your Kodi box, you need to enable the "Allow remote control via HTTP", "Allow remote control from applications on this system", and "Allow remote control from applications on other systems" options in your Kodi settings. (Note that wording might be change a little bit on different versions, this example is for Kodi 17).

![Kodi settings](http://i.imgur.com/YMqS8Qj.png)

Make sure to keep track of the port, username, and password you are using. Now, you'll need to have your Kodi box opened up to the internet via port forwarding. If you don't have a dedicated IP address, you'll need a dynamic DNS service to give you a static URL to use so you don't have to be constantly change this value.

Once you get that setup, you'll have to have your own server to handle the requests and pass them to your Kodi box. Since this is a Python application, it has several ways that you can run it.

Here are a few options to get started:

- [Heroku](#heroku)
- [AWS Lambda](#aws-lambda)
- ~~[Docker](#docker)~~

If you plan on running your own Apache/Nginx server, I'm sure you can figure that out yourself. Skip ahead to the [Skill setup section](#skill-setup). Keep in mind that you will have to generate a self-signed SSL cert (or Let's Encrypt) so that Amazon will allow you to use it.

## Heroku
### Pricing
[Heroku](https://heroku.com/) is a great way to get a server running for free, but there is a small limitation with the free tier on Heroku where the 'dyno' will go to sleep after 30 minutes of in-activity. This might cause some commands to timeout, but so far it seems to be the best option for getting up and running as quickly as possibly. To get around this, you can either pay for a "Hobby" server which is only $7/month. If you really don't want to pay, there is a work-a-round where you get enough free hours a month to leave this server running 24/7 if you add your Credit Card to your account. Then you can use something like [Kaffeine](http://kaffeine.herokuapp.com/) to keep it from spinning down.

### Setup
After you've setup an Heroku account, go ahead and [install the command line tool](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/). Once installed, open up a command line and run `heroku login`.

To create a new app, just run this from the command line: `heroku apps:create`. If that runs successfully, you'll see something like this:
![Create app](http://i.imgur.com/C17Ts7L.png)

Now, clone my repo: `git clone https://github.com/m0ngr31/kodi-alexa.git` and `cd kodi-alexa`.

Once you have my repo cloned and you are in the directory, you can setup the following environment variables to talk to your Kodi box:

- KODI_ADDRESS
- KODI_PORT
- KODI_USERNAME
- KODI_PASSWORD

You can do this easily from the command line: `heroku config:set KODI_ADDRESS='your_ip_or_dynamic_address' KODI_PORT='kodi_port' KODI_USERNAME='kodi_username' KODI_PASSWORD='kodi_password' --app app-name-and-number`. Changing of course for your settings. You can also use the settings page on your Heroku app to add these.

Now run `git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/your_apps_name_and_number.git`. This command will allow heroku to deploy new code based on what is in your directory.

Next, run `git push heroku master`. This will push the code to Heroku and deploy the server!

Heroku doesn't just fire up the server automatically, so you have to tell it to: `heroku ps:scale web=1 --app app-name-and-number`. Now you are ready to setup the Alexa skill.

*If I release a new update here, just browse to the repo directory in your terminal, and run these commands: `git pull origin master` and `git push heroku master`*

Now skip ahead to the [Skill setup section](#skill-setup).

## AWS Lambda
### Pricing
Lambda is a great service which lets the skill run "serverless". AWS provides credits for new accounts and should allow you to run everything the skill needs for free for 12 months. Once you are being billed for it, it will be less than $0.20/month. Very reasonalbe for what it offers.

### Setup
Getting going on Lambda is pretty straightforward. First, you'll need to create an Amazon developer account if you don't have one already. After that, browse to the [IAM Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home) where you will create a new user:

![First page](http://i.imgur.com/rymHquZ.png)
You can enter whatever username you want here, but make sure that Programmatic access is checked.

![Second page](http://i.imgur.com/TXX25BI.png)
Attach the 'AdministratorAccess` permission to the new user.

![Third page](http://i.imgur.com/83o9cen.png)
Confirmation page should look like this.

![Fourth page](http://i.imgur.com/3PZM92w.png)
Once you get here, do not leave the page! You need the Access key ID and Secret access key for the next step. If you close now you'll have to create a new user. You can't get access to the Secret access key again.

Next, run these commands to configure your computer for AWS service access:
`pip install awscli` and then `aws configure`. Just follow the prompts, and copy paste the keys when it asks for them. When it asks for location, if you are in the US, enter: `us-east-1`, and if you are in Europe: `eu-west-1`.

After you've done that, run `pip install virtualenv`. This is required for a later step.

Now, clone my repo: `git clone https://github.com/m0ngr31/kodi-alexa.git` and `cd kodi-alexa`. Once you are inside the project directory, you're going to create a new "Virtual environement" and then activate it:
`virtualenv venv` and `source venv/bin/activate` (if you are on Windows, that's `venv\Scripts\activate.bat` or `venv\Scripts\activate.ps1` for Powershell).

After successfull completion, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and `pip install zappa`. Before you deploy, you need to copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and enter the correct information for: KODI_ADDRESS, KODI_PORT, KODI_USERNAME, and KODI_PASSWORD. I'll go over the other variables in another section below.

To make an initial deployment to Lambda, just run the following command: `zappa deploy dev`. It'll take a few minutes, and at the end it will give you a URL that you will need to copy. It will look like this:
![Lambda deploy](http://i.imgur.com/5rtN5ls.png)

You are now running on Lambda! To update after there is a change here, or you updated your env variables, just run `zappa update dev`.

Now skip ahead to the [Skill setup section](#skill-setup).

## Docker

The Docker support files have been removed as there are no reports of anyone using it sucessfully. Though there were several reporting they were unable to get it to work:

https://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=53050.0
https://forum.libreelec.tv/thread-2135.html
https://forum.libreelec.tv/thread-1787.html

If you are curious or want to create a Docker version, go back to any release before 2.5.

# Skill Setup

Once you've setup your server, you'll need to configure a new Alexa skill. Head over to the [Skills list on Amazon's developer page](https://developer.amazon.com/edw/home.html#/skills/list) and hit the 'Add new skill' button.

The initial setup page looks like this:
![Inital setup skill](http://i.imgur.com/AzufQxo.png)

On the next page, you'll have to paste the `IntentSchema.json` file into the "Intent Schema" field, and paste the `SampleUtterances.txt` file in the "Sample Utterances" field. **Generate and save your Custom Slots first before pasting the Intents and Utterances to avoid errors when attempting to save**.

You need to create 9 different slots:
- MOVIES
- MOVIEGENRES
- SHOWS
- MUSICARTISTS
- MUSICALBUMS
- MUSICSONGS
- MUSICPLAYLISTS
- VIDEOPLAYLISTS
- ADDONS

To make it as easy as possible, I wrote a little webapp that will give you the information you need: [here](https://slot-generator.herokuapp.com/). You can also get the information from running `python generate_custom_slots.py` in the project directory. This will create txt files with the relevant information. If one of your slots is empty, you can just enter the word 'Empty' or something so that it'll save.

![2nd tab](http://i.imgur.com/WQYExdK.png)

The next tab has info about the server. Enter your Heroku, Lambda, or self-hosted URL here.
![3rd tab](http://i.imgur.com/GjFvKYv.png)

The fourth tab is asking about the SSL certificate. If you are using Heroku or Lambda, select the middle option.

![3rd tab](http://i.imgur.com/moGJQrx.png)

After that is pretty much just information that you can just put whatever into. Don't submit it for certification since only you will be using your server.

And now you should be set! Go ahead and try speaking a few commands to it and see if it works! If you can't get it working, try looking for support in [this thread](http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=254502) on the Kodi forum, and if you have more techinical problems, submit and issue here on Github.

Thanks!

# Additional validation of requests

To verify that incoming requests are only allowed from your own copy of the skill, you can set the `SKILL_APPID` environment variable to your own Application ID; e.g., `amzn1.ask.skill.deadbeef-4e4f-ad61-fe42-aee7d2de083d`

# Extra settings for more functionality

Setting the `SKILL_TZ` environment variable will make it so when you ask how long something has left playing, it'll respond for your correct time.
Setting the `KODI_SCHEME` to `https` allows you to talk to your Kodi box securely, but this requires some work on your end to setup.

### Music streaming
This skill now supports streaming music from your Kodi device over the internet to Alexa. Unfortunately, session data between commands when playing music is not saved by Alexa. So you have to use a database to keep track of everything. I selected MongoDB to handle this since it is Open Source and runs on everything. If you don't want to run it on your own server, you can use a service like [mLab](https://www.mlab.com/) which provides a free tier that works great for this.

Here is the disclaimer:
**You must accept this agreement saying that I'm not liable for stolen information since your username and password for Kodi will be stored in plaintext in a database and will be transferred over the internet to a HTTPS proxy server for you to have this functionality.**

You'll need to configure the MONGODB_URL, MONGODB_PORT, MONGODB_NAME, MONGODB_USER, MONGODB_PASS and ACCEPT_MUSIC_WARNING variables makes it so you can stream music from your Kodi device over the internet to Alexa.

You'll also need to run `pip install pymongo` (inside your virtualenv if you are on Lambda).

Since Alexa requires that all music it streams use HTTPS traffic, you'll need a proxy to provide this because Kodi only has plain HTTP. The USE_PROXY variable will enable your music to stream through a [simple proxy I built](https://github.com/m0ngr31/kodi-music-proxy) to make it easy. The ALT_PROXY is there if you want to self host the proxy server so you don't have to trust or rely on mine.

After you've set that up, you need to enable the music playback option on the first page of the skill setup on Amazon's developer site.


# Optimising search performance on large libraries (local installations only)

Matching what Alexa heard with content in your library isn't an exact science, and kodi-alexa uses fuzzy matching to try and help to do this reliably. It's possible if your libary is large that this may be a little slower than you'd like. If this is the case it's possible to improve the performance of the fuzzy matching module by installing the python-Levenshtein library. As it's compiled C you'll need to ensure you have python headers available on your machine and the tools required on your OS to compile the module. Using the Levenshtein module has only been tested when running the skill locally as a WSGI script. If all of the above is applicable to your deployment, you can opt to use this optimisation.

In order to include the optional module add the following line to `requirements.txt`:

`python-Levenshtein`
