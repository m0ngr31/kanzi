## About
This is a skill for Amazon Alexa that allows you to control one or more instances of [Kodi](https://kodi.tv) with your voice.

The process of setting up the skill may seem daunting at first, but the reward -- we feel -- is well worth the effort.  If you carefully follow the directions to the tee, you might find it is not as complicated as it seems.

Unfortunately, as of this moment, we cannot simply ship this skill normally as other skills on Amazon's skill marketplace.  The main technical hurdle is that some features we would need are currently only supported in the US region.  Beyond that, there is the consideration of cost for hosting the skill and the associated database backend.  Do try to keep in mind that this is a hobby project for the developers -- we do not get paid in any way.

However, we have made every effort to here to provide clear and concise documentation to allow you to make use of this skill now.

Instead of providing the exact verbiage here for each command, we strive to make the experience as natural as we can.  Simply try asking for what you want in a way that feels _right_ to you.  If a particular phrase doesn't work and you think it should, see [Getting Help](#getting-help) to notify us and we will see what we can do to accommodate the phrase you prefer.

## Getting Help
If you need help getting a server going or configuring the Skill, please visit the [support thread on the Kodi forum](http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=254502).

If you run into an actual issue with the code, please open an Issue here on Github; however, most issues you might run into will be a result of the complexity of the installation, so we urge you to first search the [support thread](http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=254502) for your issue.  If you cannot find a resolution for your issue with a search, post there and someone will help you determine if your problem lies within the skill code or your particular configuration.
