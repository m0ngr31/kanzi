## Initial Computer Setup
Unless you are going to host the skill on Heroku, there are a few things in the instructions that you will need to install before you can get started: 

 - **Python 2.7 (Python 3 will not work)**
 - Git

 There are numerous tutorials online about how to install these, so just Google how to install them on your OS if you are uncertain about how to proceed.

## Kodi Setup

Before a command from Alexa can be sent to your [Kodi](https://kodi.tv) box, you need to enable the "Allow remote control via HTTP", "Allow remote control from applications on this system", and "Allow remote control from applications on other systems" options in your [Kodi](https://kodi.tv) settings. Note that wording might be change a little bit on different versions, this example is for [Kodi](https://kodi.tv) 17.

![Kodi settings](http://i.imgur.com/YMqS8Qj.png)

Make sure to keep track of the port, username, and password you are using.

Now, you'll need to have your [Kodi](https://kodi.tv) box opened up to the internet via port forwarding.

If you don't have a dedicated IP address, you'll need a dynamic DNS service to give you a static URL to use so you don't have to be constantly change this value.

Repeat the above for each instance of [Kodi](https://kodi.tv) that you wish to control via the skill.  Remember you will need to open a separate, unique port on your router for each instance of [Kodi](https://kodi.tv).

Once you get that setup, you'll have to have your own server to handle the requests and pass them to your [Kodi](https://kodi.tv) box. Since this is a Python application, it has several ways that you can run it. Here are a few options to get started:

- [Heroku](#heroku)
- [AWS Lambda](#aws-lambda)
- ~~[Docker](#docker)~~

If you plan on running your own Apache/Nginx server, I'm sure you can figure that out yourself. Skip ahead to the [Skill setup section](#skill-setup). Keep in mind that you will have to generate a self-signed SSL cert (or Let's Encrypt) so that Amazon will allow you to use it.

### Note regarding MySQL and performance

If you are using [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) as a database backend for [Kodi](https://kodi.tv), please note that there are known issues with the optimizer in [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) 5.7.6+ that will cause any commands that involve queueing items in bulk to be tremendously slow.  There is nothing in the skill we can do to fix this, as it is technically a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) bug/limitation; however, you can either stay on [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) < 5.7.6 or you can easily migrate to another that doesn't have this problem, such as [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org).

As far as we are aware, [SQLite](https://sqlite.org) and [Emby](https://emby.media) do not share this issue.

## Heroku
### Pricing
[Heroku](https://heroku.com/) is a great way to get a server running for free, but there is a small limitation with the free tier on Heroku where the 'dyno' will go to sleep after 30 minutes of in-activity. This might cause some commands to timeout, but so far it seems to be the best option for getting up and running as quickly as possibly. To get around this, you can either pay for a "Hobby" server which is only $7/month. If you really don't want to pay, there is a work-a-round where you get enough free hours a month to leave this server running 24/7 if you add your Credit Card to your account. Then you can use something like [Kaffeine](http://kaffeine.herokuapp.com/) to keep it from spinning down.

### Limitations
Currently we do not support addressing multiple instances of [Kodi](https://kodi.tv) with [Heroku](https://heroku.com/).  If you wish to control multiple instances of [Kodi](https://kodi.tv), you will need to set up multiple copies of the skill to do so.

### Setup
After you've setup an Heroku account, click on this button below to provision a new server. Select a unique name to make upgrades easy.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://www.heroku.com/deploy/?template=https://github.com/m0ngr31/kodi-alexa)

Now skip ahead to the [Skill setup section](#skill-setup).

## AWS Lambda
### Pricing
Lambda is a great service which lets the skill run "serverless". AWS provides credits for new accounts and should allow you to run everything the skill needs for free for 12 months. Once you are being billed for it, it will be less than $0.20/month. Very reasonable for what it offers.

### Setup
Getting going on Lambda is pretty straightforward. First, you'll need to create an Amazon developer account if you don't have one already. After that, browse to the [IAM Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home) where you will create a new user:

![First page](http://i.imgur.com/rymHquZ.png)
You can enter whatever username you want here, but make sure that Programmatic access is checked.

![Second page](http://i.imgur.com/TXX25BI.png)
Attach the 'AdministratorAccess` permission to the new user.

![Third page](http://i.imgur.com/83o9cen.png)
Confirmation page should look like this.

![Fourth page](http://i.imgur.com/3PZM92w.png)
Once you get here, do not leave the page! You need the Access key ID and Secret access key for the next step. If you close now you'll have to create a new user. You can't get access to the Secret access key again.

Next, run these commands to configure your computer for AWS service access:
`pip install awscli` and then `aws configure`. Just follow the prompts, and copy paste the keys when it asks for them. When it asks for location, if you are in the US, enter: `us-east-1`, and if you are in Europe: `eu-west-1`.

After you've done that, run `pip install virtualenv`. This is required for a later step.

Now, clone my repo: `git clone https://github.com/m0ngr31/kodi-alexa.git` and `cd kodi-alexa`. Once you are inside the project directory, you're going to create a new "Virtual environement" and then activate it:
`virtualenv venv` and `source venv/bin/activate` (if you are on Windows, that's `venv\Scripts\activate.bat` or `venv\Scripts\activate.ps1` for Powershell).

Next you need to create the file `kodi.config` from the [kodi.config.example template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m0ngr31/kodi-voice/master/kodi_voice/kodi.config.example) and enter the correct information for: address, port, username, and password. I'll go over the other variables in another section below.

After you've created your config file, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and `pip install packaging zappa lambda-packages`.

Before you can send any code to Lambda, you'll need to set up Zappa. Just run `zappa init` and accept the defaults for everything. If it doesn't automatically detect that this is a Flask app, tell it that the application function is `alexa.app`.

To make an initial deployment to Lambda, just run the following command: `zappa deploy dev`. It'll take a few minutes, and at the end it will give you a URL that you will need to copy. It will look like this:
![Lambda deploy](http://i.imgur.com/5rtN5ls.png)

You are now running on Lambda! To update after there is a change here, or you updated your env variables, see the instructions in UPGRADING.md.

Now skip ahead to the [Skill setup section](#skill-setup).

## Docker

The Docker support files have been removed as there are no reports of anyone using it sucessfully. Though there were several reporting they were unable to get it to work:

https://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=53050.0
https://forum.libreelec.tv/thread-2135.html
https://forum.libreelec.tv/thread-1787.html

If you are curious or want to create a Docker version, go back to any release before 2.5.

# Skill Setup

If you are self-hosting, you will need to create the file `kodi.config` from the [kodi.config.example template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m0ngr31/kodi-voice/master/kodi_voice/kodi.config.example).  The template file contains comments to describe the options.

Once you've set up your server, you'll need to configure a new Alexa skill. Head over to the [Skills list on Amazon's developer page](https://developer.amazon.com/edw/home.html#/skills/list) and hit the 'Add new skill' button.

The initial setup page looks like this:
![Inital setup skill](http://i.imgur.com/AzufQxo.png)

On the next page, you'll have to paste the contents of the [IntentSchema.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m0ngr31/kodi-alexa/master/speech_assets/IntentSchema.json) file into the "Intent Schema" field, and paste the contents of the [SampleUtterances.en.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m0ngr31/kodi-alexa/master/speech_assets/SampleUtterances.en.txt) or [SampleUtterances.de.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m0ngr31/kodi-alexa/master/speech_assets/SampleUtterances.de.txt) file in the "Sample Utterances" field. **Generate and save your Custom Slots first before pasting the Intents and Utterances to avoid errors when attempting to save**.

You need to create the following slots:
- MOVIES
- MOVIEGENRES
- SHOWS
- SHOWGENRES
- MUSICVIDEOS
- MUSICVIDEOGENRES
- MUSICARTISTS
- MUSICALBUMS
- MUSICSONGS
- MUSICGENRES
- MUSICPLAYLISTS
- VIDEOPLAYLISTS
- ADDONS

To make it as easy as possible, I wrote a little webapp that will give you the information you need: [here](https://slot-generator.herokuapp.com/).

You can also get the information from running `python generate_custom_slots.py` in the project directory. This will create txt files with the relevant information. This will communicate with the Kodi instance defined in the `[DEFAULT]` section in `kodi.config`. *NOTE: If you're deploying to Heroku, you cannot use the python slot generator unless you create the kodi.config file.  It's best to use the webapp for generating slots in this case.*

If one of your slots is empty, you can just enter the word 'Empty' or something so that it'll save.

![2nd tab](http://i.imgur.com/WQYExdK.png)

The next tab has info about the server. Enter your Heroku, Lambda, or self-hosted URL here.
![3rd tab](http://i.imgur.com/GjFvKYv.png)

The fourth tab is asking about the SSL certificate. If you are using Heroku or Lambda, select the middle option.

![3rd tab](http://i.imgur.com/moGJQrx.png)

After that is pretty much just information that you can just put whatever into. Don't submit it for certification since only you will be using your server.

And now you should be set! Go ahead and try speaking a few commands to it and see if it works! If you can't get it working, see the [Getting Help section](#getting-help).

Thanks!

# Controlling more than one instance of Kodi

As of version 2.6 of the skill, it can now control more than one instance of [Kodi](https://kodi.tv).  The skill determines which instance to talk to by determining which Echo device received the command.

You set up the mapping in the `kodi.config` file. There are a few examples there with dummy device IDs.

If a device ID isn't explicitly present in the config file, it will utilize the details in the `[DEFAULT]` section.  So, for example, if you wanted most of your devices to send commands to [Kodi](https://kodi.tv) in your living room, you would set the `[DEFAULT]` section to point at that instance.  For any that you want to override -- say, office and master bedroom -- you would define override sections with those device IDs.

Further, for override sections, if a variable isn't defined, it will inherit it from the `[DEFAULT]` section.  Thus, if the only thing you need to change is `address` and `port`, define just those in the override.  You do not need to copy all of the other variables as well.

## Getting the device IDs

When you send a request to the skill, it will log an entry on the skill's server that will look something like this:

`Sending request to http://mydomain.com:8080/jsonrpc from device amzn1.ask.device.AEFDXCGLSFJFNGCVF8SDJF90FID9G284JDJFGJGHH83358DJFFGIGD734JJDFGK211GDFFHHH23HGFJTYEFGJRT56KJDHDFJ5546DJDFFSWOPPP677P88P873EHZNZDFEIRTYIN2239NDFGIH724JDFKS2AA`

For AWS Lambda/Zappa deployments, you can access your logs with:

`zappa tail dev`

To generate your override sections, you will want to tail (watch the end of) the log file and send any request (like, `Alexa, ask Kodi what is playing?`) from the Echo device you wish to override.  Look for a line that looks like the above.  The device ID is everything from `amzn1.ask.device.` to the end of the line.  Copy this text and paste it to the end of the `kodi.config` file, placing it within square brackets `[]`, like so:

`[amzn1.ask.device.AEFDXCGLSFJFNGCVF8SDJF90FID9G284JDJFGJGHH83358DJFFGIGD734JJDFGK211GDFFHHH23HGFJTYEFGJRT56KJDHDFJ5546DJDFFSWOPPP677P88P873EHZNZDFEIRTYIN2239NDFGIH724JDFKS2AA]`

Anything in square brackets denotes a new section.  In this section, you can override whatever variables you'd like.  In this example, this Echo device is my Echo Dot in the office, so I would do something like:

```
# Office Echo Dot
[amzn1.ask.device.AEFDXCGLSFJFNGCVF8SDJF90FID9G284JDJFGJGHH83358DJFFGIGD734JJDFGK211GDFFHHH23HGFJTYEFGJRT56KJDHDFJ5546DJDFFSWOPPP677P88P873EHZNZDFEIRTYIN2239NDFGIH724JDFKS2AA]
address = office-dot
```

# Additional validation of requests

To verify that incoming requests are only allowed from your own copy of the skill, you can set the `skill_id` configuration variable to your own Application ID; e.g., `amzn1.ask.skill.deadbeef-4e4f-ad61-fe42-aee7d2de083d`

## Extra settings for more functionality

### Set your timezone so Alexa can calculate what time things will end

Setting the `timezone` configuration variable will make it so when you ask how long something has left playing, it'll also tell you when it will end according to your local wall-clock time.

### Use HTTPS for a secure connection

Kodi doesn't support SSL, this means that the traffic between the Skill and your local network is not secure. If you want a secure connection you have to set this up yourself. There are a number of ways you can do this, Google "https local network" if you want a starting point. [This guide from htpcguides](https://www.htpcguides.com/secure-nginx-reverse-proxy-with-lets-encrypt-on-ubuntu-16-04-lts/) is also very useful. But you are your own as we can't support you.

Once you have your own https solution setup and working you need to change the `scheme` from `http` to `https` for each of the Kodi webservers you have added in your `kodi.config` file.


### Disable "Deep search" and be more specific if requests are taking too long

By default, the skill allows very generic commands such as

* _play 99 red balloons_
* _shuffle the office_
* _play slippery when wet_

A human would look at that and know that _99 Red Balloons_ is a song, _The Office_ is a TV show (with both US and UK versions) and _Slippery When Wet_ is a bitchin album by Bon Jovi.

Alexa is stupid and doesn't know these things and will go off searching whatever she can trying to find the thing you asked for.

You can help her out by giving her more information to work with, for example:

* _play the song 99 red balloons_
* _watch a random episode of the office_
* _play the album slippery when wet_

Being more specific might seem a little tedius, but you should get more accurate results. 

#### Too many timeouts?

If you have a large library this can mean searching through tens of thousands of items before finding a match. Search technology today is very fast, even this little Skill can whip through 40,000 items in a couple of seconds. But the Skill is seperate from your Kodi box, transfering the data from one to the other is the bigger problem.

If you have a slow internet connection (specifically the upload speed) this might cause timeouts and you will hear "the requested skill took too long to respond".

If these timeouts bother you disable `deep_search` which means you have to the state whether it is a movie, show, episode, song, album, artist etc

### Optimising search performance on larger libraries (self-host only)

Matching what Alexa heard with content in your library isn't an exact science, and kodi-alexa uses fuzzy matching to try and help to do this reliably. It's possible if your libary is large that this may be a little slower than you'd like. If this is the case it's possible to improve the performance of the fuzzy matching module by installing the python-Levenshtein library. As it's compiled C you'll need to ensure you have python headers available on your machine and the tools required on your OS to compile the module. Using the Levenshtein module has only been tested when running the skill locally as a WSGI script. If all of the above is applicable to your deployment, you can opt to use this optimisation.

In order to include the optional module add the following line to `requirements.txt`:

`python-Levenshtein`
