# A list of utterance variations written in a shorthand syntax

# Syntax and information
# http://www.makermusings.com/2015/07/21/defining-utterances-for-the-alexa-skills-kit/

# Tool to expand the single line into the usable list of utterances
# http://www.makermusings.com/amazon-echo-utterance-expander/

# Utterances that include a reference to a Slot are more specific than
# others because, in testing, Alexa appears to not fuzzy match these
# as well as those that have no slot references.
