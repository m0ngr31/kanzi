# Contributing Guide

## Please Read
If you would like to contribute, please keep the following in mind:
 - If you make a change that affects the setup (ex. Adding a new custom slot type), make sure you're updating the README file.
 - If you make a new intent, make sure that you follow the same syntax as the rest of the templates. DO NOT just put English text in `alexa.py` file.
   - Make sure you look at the translating guide below to get your intent ready for translation.

## Needs
 - Translation help! If you are a native German speaker, please help with staying on top of new intents and responses. Look at the translating guide below to get setup.
 - New features and refactoring. Please test all code extensively before you commit.

## Translating
There are two main areas translation needs to happen. The sampleUtterances and templates files. Translation should be pretty straight forward.


## Financial contributions

We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/kodi-alexa).
Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.
